Generic ways to use ONOS utilities are described [here](https://github.com/onfsdn/atrium-docs/wiki/ONOS-Utils-Fabric-16A). 

As for Accton and OF-DPA usage (which is the same for the Atrium Router and Fabric), details can be found [here](https://github.com/onfsdn/atrium-docs/wiki/Switch-Utils-Fabric-16A)

Finally for NoviFlow switches, it is best to obtain a NoviSwitch O&M Manual directly from NoviFlow. Some useful commands are described [here](https://github.com/onfsdn/atrium-docs/wiki/User-Guide-Switches-15A#NoviFlow)
