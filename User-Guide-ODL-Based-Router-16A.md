An all-in-built virtual machine is available  [here](https://github.com/onfsdn/atrium-docs/wiki) to play around with the Opendaylight implementation of the BGP Peering Router use case.  Before getting into the details, first letâ€™s familiarize the main components in the BGP Peering Router. 
a)	Data Plane Switch (OpenvSwitch or different vendor switches, e.g: Pica8, Noviflow, Accton etc) 
b)	Opendaylight Controller (aligned to Lithium release) 
c)	BGP Routing Application 
d)	DIDM Drivers 
e)	Flow Objectives API
f)	Control Plane Switch (OpenvSwitch)  
g)	Quagga Soft Router 

Following diagram shows how these components fit together to form BGP Router.
