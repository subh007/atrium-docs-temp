### Introduction

In this section, we describe how to configure the fabric on ONOS using the network-cfg.json file. We will describe ports, devices and hosts configuration. Note that in this example we are assuming that the file network-cfg.json.fabric.nolearn.mn has been copied into network-cfg.json. Where necessary, we will point out differences to other sample config.

#### Configuring Interfaces

In ONOS, applications typically require configuration for external facing interfaces (external to the SDN island), to interface and interact with the outside world.
